# Klondike Solitaire (C++ Console)

A C++20 console implementation of Klondike Solitaire with basic features including undo support (up to 3 moves). Built using CMake 3.29+.

## Requirements

- C++20-compatible compiler (e.g. `g++ 11+`, `clang++ 12+`, or MSVC)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) version 3.29 or newer
- A terminal that supports basic ANSI output

## Build Instructions

1. Create a build directory and run CMake:

    ```bash
    mkdir build (if the directory does not exist)
    ```

2. Run configuration:

    ```bash
    cmake -S . -B build -G "MinGW Makefiles" .
    ```

3. Build the project (from project directory):

    ```bash
    cmake --build build
    ```

4. Run the built executable:

    ```bash
    build/Solitaire.exe
    ```



## How to Play

The game is played entirely via text commands in the terminal. Available commands:

- `DRAW`  
  Draw the next card from the stock.

- `MOVE <src> <dst> <count>`  
  Move a card or stack from one location to another.  
  Use the game's printed identifiers (e.g., `W1`, `T3`, `F2`).

- `UNDO`  
  Undo the most recent move (up to 3 previous moves are stored).

- `RESTART`  
  Restart the current game from a new shuffle.

- `HELP`  
  Display a brief command guide during gameplay.

- `QUIT`  
  Exit the application.

The game will print the current board state and list available commands after each move.
