# Klondike Solitaire (C++ Console)

A C++ console implementation of Klondike Solitaire with basic features including undo support (up to 3 moves). Built using CMake.

## Requirements

- C++20-compatible compiler (e.g., `g++ 11+`, `clang++ 12+`, or MSVC)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) version 3.29 or newer
- A terminal that supports basic ANSI output

## Build Instructions

1. Navigate to the project directory (where `CMakeLists.txt` is located):
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/Solitaire

2. Create a build directory and run CMake:  
   _(Only if the directory does not exist)_
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   ```

3. Run configuration:
   ```bash
   cmake -S . -B build -G "MinGW Makefiles"
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cmake --build build
   ```

5. Run the built executable:
   ```bash
   build/Solitaire.exe
   ```

## How to Play

The game is played entirely via text commands in the terminal. Available commands:

- `DRAW`  
  Draw the next card from the stock and move it to waste.

- `MOVE <src> <dst> [count]`  
  Move a card or stack from one location to another.  
  Use the game's stack identifiers (e.g., `W`, `T3`, `F2`).

- `UNDO`  
  Undo the most recent move (up to 3 moves).

- `RESTART`  
  Restart the current game from a new shuffle.

- `HELP`  
  Display a brief command guide during gameplay.

- `QUIT`  
  Exit the application.
